title: Week 9
---

## Previous goals
- Review and merge the new pipeline.
- Run the new pipeline on the new Flexeme decomposition and SmartCommit decomposition
- Update RQ2 analysis to remove the performance biais generated the tools
- Open issues for remaining work on the paper. The todo list is in my personal notes at the moment.
- Work on the paper
## Progress
This week I mainly work on the paper and one extra last experiment, which is running Flexeme on the synthetic benchmark.
We have 2 days!
- I merged in the clean-java implementation (finally) which worked on all files. I also investigated the perplexing issues of why SmartCommit failed on a nontrivial number of bugs before but succeeded on all bugs now - turns out, it is a very specific issue which the checked out Defects4J bug repository, which caused git diff command between the buggy SHA hash and the fixed SHA hash to error.
- Generated a synthetic benchmark on Defects4J using Flexeme's heuristics and obtained results for Flexeme synthetic benchmark. It's too ambitious to actually implement research question 3, and with Thomas' advice I decided to put a hold on trying to run SmartCommit on the synthetic benchmark.
- As Thomas updated RQ2 to work with the new metrics and investigated the effect of the tool performance on the metrics, we met to discuss the paper writing directions and only worked on polishing the papers/results on the day of the submission. 
- Addressed feedback, worked on TODOs, ran extra experiments and analyses as required by the paper.
## Next goals
Take a break for the rest of the week!
