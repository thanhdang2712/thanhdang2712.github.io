## About Me

My name is Thanh (pronounced /θæŋ/, like "Tang" or "Thank" without the 'k'). I am a rising junior at Colgate University, majoring in Computer Science & minoring in Mathematics. I have had experience doing research on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and those academic interests of mine have always been driven by a passion for innovation and the desire to create something meaningful. This summer, I am so grateful to be accepted into the DREU 2023 Program to conduct Software Engineering research!

My hometown is Hanoi, Vietnam, and I'm always eager to share with you stories of my culture and people. My other hobbies include playing the piano, cooking and weightlifting. I am a Capricorn, INFJ, and food enthusiast!

## About My Mentor

I am advised by [Dr. Michael Ernst](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/), Professor at the Paul G. Allen Computer & Engineering School at the University of Washington.

## About My Project

### Project Title: An Empirical Evaluation of Commit-Untangling Tools
A tangled code change is a commit containing multiple concerns, such as both a bug fix and a refactoring. Tangled code change induces a higher cognitive load in Software Engineering, making code reviews more costly and error-prone. While there exist untangling tools that automatically cluster code changes into distinct groups they have rarely been evaluated on real commits. Our project aims to address this research gap by proposing an evaluation pipeline for two untangling tools, SmartCommit and Flexeme, on real commits. We hope to evaluate the tool's respective untangling performance and gain insights into the significant features of tangled commits.
