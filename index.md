## About Me

My name is Thanh (pronounced /θæŋ/, like "Tang" or "Thank" without the 'k'). I am a rising junior at Colgate University, majoring in Computer Science & minoring in Mathematics. I have had experience doing research on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and those academic interests of mine have always been driven by a passion for innovation and the desire to create something meaningful. This summer, I am so grateful to be accepted into the DREU 2023 Program to conduct Software Engineering research!

My hometown is Hanoi, Vietnam, and I'm always eager to share with you stories of my culture and people. My other hobbies include playing the piano, cooking and weightlifting. I am a Capricorn, INFJ, and food enthusiast!
